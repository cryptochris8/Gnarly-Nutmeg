# ‚öΩ Hytopia Soccer Game

A sophisticated 6v6 multiplayer soccer game built with the Hytopia SDK, featuring advanced AI systems, physics-based gameplay, and professional-level architecture.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.45. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## üìä Project Overview

### **Statistics**
- **Total Codebase**: 10,000+ lines across key files
- **Main Server**: `index.ts` (939 lines)
- **Dependencies**: Hytopia SDK v0.6.6, TypeScript, Bun runtime
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### **Core Features**
- **6v6 Multiplayer**: Red vs Blue teams with AI filling empty slots
- **Advanced AI**: 3,451 lines of sophisticated behavior tree logic
- **Physics-Based**: Realistic ball mechanics and player interactions
- **Complete Soccer Rules**: Throw-ins, corner kicks, goal kicks, offside
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and responsive UI
- **Abilities System**: Speed boosts and special power-ups

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Core Game Logic**
- `state/gameState.ts` (1,236 lines) - Main game state management
- `state/gameConfig.ts` - Stadium setup and AI configuration
- `state/map.ts` - Goal detection and boundary systems

### **Entity System**
- `entities/SoccerPlayerEntity.ts` - Custom player with team mechanics
- `entities/AIPlayerEntity.ts` (3,451 lines) - Advanced AI with behavior trees
- `entities/BehaviorTree.ts` (676 lines) - AI decision-making logic

### **Controllers**
- `controllers/SoccerPlayerController.ts` (1,241 lines) - Player controls
- `controllers/AIController.ts` - AI movement coordination

### **Utilities**
- `utils/ball.ts` - Physics-based soccer ball system
- `utils/observer.ts` - Spectator camera functionality
- `utils/direction.ts` - Movement calculations

### **User Interface**
- `assets/ui/index.html` (707 lines) - Complete web-based UI

## ü§ñ AI System

The AI system is one of the most sophisticated aspects of this project:

- **Behavior Trees**: Complex decision-making with role-specific logic
- **Role-Based Positioning**: Goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, strikers
- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: Smart movement coordination
- **Situational Awareness**: Responds to ball position and game state
- **Team Coordination**: AI players work together strategically

## ‚öΩ Game Features
